# HMC Summer Dara Science REU 2018
HMC Summer Data Science Workshop: R Bootcamp Day1 and Day 2

## This R bootcamp is...
* about R's programming aspects.
  - It's designed to help you start using and coding R.
* not about Statistics.
  - I assume that you already have a basic knowledge of Statistics
* for your summer research and beyond.
  - This bootcamp materials are used to help you get up to speed on using R as quickly as possible for your research activites
